Mario_PyGame

When I was younger, I used to spend a lot of my time playing video games
with friends and one of these games was Super Mario. Ive always wanted to
recreate a platform game, so I tried recreating some aspects and functions
of Super Mario on PyGame.

I do have to admit that some of the sprites used in this game don't
look great as I couldn't find the ones I was looking for, but the main goal
of this project was to recreate some of the interactions and abilities of
characters in the game. I'm sure that I will be working on bigger and
more complete platform games some time in the future.
